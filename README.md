About the Project
The rapid proliferation of messaging platforms like WhatsApp has led to the daily generation of vast volumes of textual data. This presents a unique opportunity to dissect human behavior through digital correspondence. This final year project delves into WhatsApp messages, employing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to unearth behavioral and emotional patterns.

Beyond traditional sentiment detection, this project utilizes a comprehensive approach by integrating various machine learning and clustering methods to holistically analyze individual and group behaviors. The ultimate goal is to contribute valuable insights to the field of behavioral analytics, with strict adherence to ethical standards.

Features
Sentiment Analysis: Classifies WhatsApp messages into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments using advanced machine learning algorithms.
Keyword Extraction: Identifies significant keywords within conversations using CountVectorizer.
Topic Modeling: Uncovers underlying themes and topics in conversational content using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
Group Behavior Analysis: Employs K-means clustering to analyze group dynamics, including participation levels and response patterns in group chats.
Temporal Keyword Trend Analysis: Investigates the evolution of keyword usage over time through frequency analysis.
User-Friendly Interface: (Implied by HTML files) A web-based interface for interaction.
